# Marketably.ai - Complete Information

> Voice-of-Customer driven Facebook ads that beat your agency's best work - guaranteed.

## Company Overview

Marketably.ai is a specialized Facebook ads and conversion rate optimization (CRO) consultancy founded by David Rawlings. The core value proposition is transforming buried customer feedback into high-performing ad concepts using a proprietary framework built on research analyzing 100+ million Facebook posts.

Unlike traditional agencies that recycle generic hooks across clients, Marketably extracts actual customer language from surveys, reviews, support tickets, and interviews to create ads that resonate with real buying motivations.

## Founder Background

**David Rawlings**
- 10+ years experience in voice-of-customer research and conversion optimization
- Former consultant at Conversion Rate Experts
- Worked with 49+ brands generating hundreds of millions in revenue
- Built Marketably to close the gap between customer insights and ad execution

Quote from David: "I built this because I was tired of watching killer insights die in forgotten slide-decks. Teams would run surveys, collect reviews, talk to customers, then turn around and ship ads that sounded nothing like what they'd just learned."

## Methodology

### The Four-Step Process

**Step 1: Ingest**
Upload customer research:
- Survey responses
- Review data
- Support tickets
- Interview transcripts
- Any voice-of-customer source
- (No VoC yet? Marketably helps gather it)

**Step 2: Analyze**
The engine identifies:
- High-signal language patterns
- Emotional trigger points
- Job-to-be-done frameworks
- Objections and anxieties
- Motivation clusters

**Step 3: Formulate**
Customer insights are filtered through an ad construction framework built on research analyzing 100+ million Facebook posts. This framework knows:
- Which emotional hooks stop scrolls (not which sound clever)
- Which proof patterns trigger purchases (not which win awards)
- Which benefit structures convert (not which feel on-brand)

**Step 4: Generate**
Ready-to-test ad concepts delivered:
- 10 Facebook ad variations
- Hooks in customer language
- Primary text and headlines optimized for thumb-stopping readability
- Image/video creative prompts
- Testing prioritization based on proven patterns

### Why This Works

**Agency Limitations:**
- Agencies juggle 10+ clients, spending ~45 minutes/month per account
- They never deeply read customer data - skim first page, steal phrases
- They bill for testing that never happens (3 variations of same ad)
- They're learning on your dime, spending 3-6 months "getting to know your brand"

**Marketably's Edge:**
- 10 years mastering VoC across 49 brands
- Framework built on 100+ million Facebook posts
- Pattern recognition from hundreds of millions in revenue
- What took a decade to learn gets applied to your brand in 14 days

## Frequently Asked Questions

If a 10% lift in conversion would generate more profit than the monthly fee, you're a strong fit. Median lift is 15-25%.

**What's the guarantee?**
One primary metric; ≥20% relative lift (CRO) or 40%+ improvement (ads) or you owe $0.

**What are the traffic requirements?**

NDA + DPA standard; minimal data collection (survey responses, session replays); data purged within 30 days.
